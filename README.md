You just started working at a game development company named Eastwood Studios and they decided to create a new text-based role-playing video game. You are responsible for implementing the inventory system of the game, which stores, shows, and manages goods the player acquires.

As there are other developers on this project, who implement other parts of the game, it's crucial to use the provided function names and conform with the requirements to have a working final product. Also note that your git commit messages communicate your intents to your team-mates, so make sure to write meaningful ones.
